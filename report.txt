SUMMARY:
Now, his calculation is now a complete world. But you are a master's student. He wrote all this. After that, he came to the top. An object in the field that is filled with force. Is it a weight? Yes. So, what I am going to do is, I am going to put weight on the side. M1, M2, G. How much is the mass?...

FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Now, his calculation is now a complete world. But you are a master's student. He wrote all this. After that, he came to the top. An object in the field that is filled with force. Is it a weight? Yes. So, what I am going to do is, I am going to put weight on the side. M1, M2, G. How much is the mass? 1 kg? G value? 9.8? What will be 9.8 and weight unit? Newton. That means, the answer will be 9.8. After that, let him give it a hit. Don't tell anyone. Don't do anything. Don't do anything. If you want to make a small hole here, then cut it. This is it.
